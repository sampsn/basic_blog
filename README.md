# basic_blog

Practice - Make a blog using basic html, css, javascript and a backend using
python and postgres.

The goal of these "basic" web apps that I will be building is to start building
a solid foundation of knowledge for how web apps work, all the way through the
stack.

This first one I will use HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front end. For the
backend, I will use Python, FastAPI, Postgres, etc.
